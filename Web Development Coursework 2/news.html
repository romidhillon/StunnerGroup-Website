    <!-- Knowledge and guidance of nav classes has been taken from the Bootstrap documentation at the following link: [5] https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navbar/. 
         The navbar has been created from scratch and is purely my own work  -->
    <!-- To begin with, a structure of an unordered list with list items has been used to encapsulate the various navbar links-->
    <!-- A class of nav-link has been used so that the link can be styled with a hover feature-->
    <!-- A class of navbar-expand has been used to ensure navbar responsiveness to different sized screens or devices. The class helps to expand the navigation items depending 
         on how large the screen is. The option that i have chosen is navbar-expand-lg which is the large setting for the class, This means that the navbar will stack vertically 
         when viewed on a device such as an IPad or IPhone. On a large screen or laptop, the navbar will stack horizontally, unless the screen is minimised  -->
    <!-- The bg-dark class has been used to set a dark grey background for the navbar. The various colours that can be used are easily seen in the 'buttons' section of the 
         Bootstrap documentation, found at the following link: [6] https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/buttons/ 
         The navbar font has been set as navbar-dark to ensure that an 'off-white' colour is used for the links-->
    <!-- A fixed top navigation bar has been opted for, as it ensures the user can have sight of the nav-bar whilst scrolling down the page.  -->



    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm fixed-top navbar-dark bg-dark ">

        <!--  A class of navbar-brand has been created, imbedding within an anchor tag to insert the brand image. The description on how to insert a brand name 
              is provided in the Bootstrap documentation found at the following link: [5] https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navbar/-->
        <!--  An anchor tag has been created for the logo to ensure that the user can go back to the home page (index.html) by clicking the logo.  -->

        <!-- The code for the button below has been taken directly from the Bootstrap Documentation from the following URL: [7] https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navbar/#toggler -->
        <!-- A hamburger menu has been incorporated for the navbar links when the screen is minimised to a certain size, or when viewing the content from a smartphone or ipad.
             This ensures a level of responsiveness and ease of use. The method of applying this to my code was taken from the 'toggler' section of the Bootstrap documentation 
             found at the following link: [7] https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navbar/#toggler -->
        <!-- To ensure that the hamburger menu functions, a button has been added which targets the specific ID of #navbarTogglerDemo02 so that it knows that when you click on 
             the button, which div to collapse or uncollapse. Also note how the anchor tag for the brand has been placed above the button as this ensures that the brand is shown
             on the left of the screen and the button is shown on the right of the screen when in mobile/minimised mode. Another important iteration is that the ml-auto class has 
             been moved from the unordered list to the div container so that the navbar text still appears on the right of the screen  -->

        </button>

        <!-- An unordered list has been created with Bootstrap classes, which included four list items - New Products, Macros, Events, News -->
        <!-- I have chosen to move the unordered list to the right of the screen by adding margin through a class of ml-auto to the unordered list. The auto element of the class 
             pushes the text with as much margin that can be created to the edge of the screen -->
