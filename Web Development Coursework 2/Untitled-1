        <!-- To begin with, a structure of an unordered list with list items has been used to encapsulate the various navbar links-->
        <!-- A class of nav-link has been used so that the link can be styled with a hover feature-->
        <!-- A class of navbar-expand has been used to ensure navbar responsiveness to different sized screens or devices. The class helps to expand the navigation items depending 
             on how large the screen is. The option that i have chosen is navbar-expand-lg which is the large setting for the class, This means that the navbar will stack vertically 
             when viewed on a device such as an IPad or IPhone. On a large screen or laptop, the navbar will stack horizontally, unless the screen is minimised  -->
        <!-- The bg-dark class has been used to set a dark grey background for the navbar. The various colours that can be used are easily seen in the 'buttons' section of the 
             Bootstrap documentation, found at the following link: [6] https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/buttons/ 
             The navbar font has been set as navbar-dark to ensure that an 'off-white' colour is used for the links-->

            <!-- To ensure that the hamburger menu functions, a button has been added which targets the specific ID of #navbarTogglerDemo02 so that it knows that when you click on 
                 the button, which div to collapse or uncollapse. Also note how the anchor tag for the brand has been placed above the button as this ensures that the brand is shown
                 on the left of the screen and the button is shown on the right of the screen when in mobile/minimised mode. Another important iteration is that the ml-auto class has 
                 been moved from the unordered list to the div container so that the navbar text still appears on the right of the screen  -->

                 On a large sized device (i.e. laptop or bigger), the heading h1 and buttons take a column of 6 units by using the class col-lg-6. The heading and buttons are take up 8 units on a medium and small sized 
                 device. This means that the heading and buttons within the division remain responsive when the user uses different screen sizes. -->

         Bootstrap classes have been used to style the divisions (column class large with four units - to take up a third of the screen on a large device). These have been nested inside a div class named 'row' 
         as required by the Bootstrap framework. Therefore, each div is laid across the same row. The responsiveness is also present, as the divisions take up 100% of the width when the screen is minimised 
         past a certain point.  -->

                 like buttons, you don't want the screen reader to read out 'left button' or 'right button'. The aria hidden feature makes the screen reader skip over the button span so that a visually

         [17] https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/card/#card-decks -->
    <!-- Three separate cards were first created using the div class 'card' in each case. Two divisions have been created within each card with classes named 
         card header and card body. The header of the card goes inside the card header, and the body of the card encapsulates the additional wording through 
         the use of headings and paragraphs.  -->
    <!-- In order to stack the cards next to each other horizontally (rather than vertically), a div class of card deck has been used to wrap all of the other
         cards inside of it - Please note that this was modified as the code progressed (see further comments)  -->
    <!-- The cards have been placed within the Bootstrap grid system in order to size them accordingly to how responsive you want the website to be. The importance here 
         is to make the third card to 100% of the width when displayed on an iPad, whilst keeping the first two cards at a width of 50%. Only when moving to the mobile 
         size do all three cards display at 100% of the screen.  -->
    <!-- In order to implement the grid system, the card-deck class was replaced with 'row'. Within this, a new division has been created for each card with class col-lg-4 so that each card 
         takes up 4 units (1/3 of the screen) when on a large device.  -->
    <!-- On a medium sized devices such as an iPad, the top two cards need to take up half of the width of the page, which is col-md-6. This is why the first two cards have this 
         class applied to them. For a small sized device, all three cards now sit underneath each other (100% of the width of the screen) -->
    <!-- The card buttons have also been styled using Bootstrap classes i.e. btn. The btn-lg class specifies that the button needs to be large. The class btn-block means that the button takes up the
