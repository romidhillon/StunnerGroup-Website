    <p class="text-secondary introp1">Report: Web Development Coursework 2. Name: Romi Dhillon</p>
    <p class="text-dark introp2">What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you
        choose to implement? </p>
    <p class="text-dark introp3"> A business was created five years ago named Stunner Group. It consists of three main
        divisions and product lines. The first division is named Stunner Group Fitness, which focuses on
        fitness products such as Protein Shakes and Protein Bars. The second division is Stunner Group Cosmetics which
        focuses on men's makeup. The third division is Stunner Group Biotics which focuses on
        vitamins, minerals and supplements for various health ailments. By working alongside the owner of Stunner Group,
        it was agreed that the spotlight would be on the Stunner Group Fitness division, and that a
        newsletter/informational site would be created for the the new Stunner Group App, latest products, upcoming
        exhibitions
        and general news. All of these aspects have been incorporated into the website.
    </p>
    <p class="text-dark introp4"> The Bootstrap framework was used for the main structure throughout the design of
        the website.

<div id="Inspiration" class=" container-fluid bg-light text-dark text-justify mt-0 pt-0">
    <h1><u>Inspiration</u></h1>
    <p class="text-dark inspirationp1">State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</p>
    <p class="text-dark inspirationp1">I have known the owner of Stunner Group for the last thirteen years, as he studied with me
        when i completed
        my first degree (BEng(Hons) Mechanical Engineering). Since then, he has held positions in corporate finance
        institutions and was
        named Forbes 30 under 30. He has made a success of Stunner Group and i was inspired to create a website for him
        which would act as
        a newsletter/informational website for the launch of his new Stunner Group Fitness App and protein shakes.
        My inspiration led me to create a high quality site for the
        organisation, which can be developed further in the future; rather than simply creating a site only for a
        coursework assignment. </p>
    <p class="text-dark inspirationp1"> I was also inspired by my colleagues at work that have switched from a career in
        Mechanical Engineering and
        have now become front-end and back-end developers. I have used the Matlab programming language extensively in
        the past, however,
        i am inspired by alternative languages such HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, MySQL etc. It is my
        passion to develop my skills
        and gain an awareness of all of these languages. Therefore, the inspiration was to learn as much as i can in
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript
        during the web development module and in particular, focus on the Bootstrap framework; as i find it to be very
        structured and ordered. </p>
    <p class=" text-dark inspirationp1"> Another reason why i was inspired to create a website was due to my desire of creating my
        own business. Possessing
        a high level of skill when developing websites will be very beneficial when i decide to develop my website for
        my own business. </p>

<div id="Accessibility" class=" container-fluid bg-light text-justify mt-0 pt-0">
    <h1><u>Accessibility</u></h1>
    <p class="text-dark accessp1">State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</p>
    <p class="text-dark accessp2"> I conducted additional research and tried my best to follow the Web Content
        Accessibility
        Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) when creating an accessible website.
        A carousel in the index.html file was created using the Bootstrap framework. When creating the carousel, the
        knowledge of the carousel
        structure was taken from documentation found at the following link
        :https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/carousel/#with-controls. As part of the carousel design, the
        'aria-hidden' feature was added to the code, and was set to true. This is a very intriguing aspect of the code
        as
        a visually impaired person may come across the website. A visually impaired person often uses a screen reader,
        which goes through the website, and reads what is written on the site. Therefore, this feature was purposely
        incorporated into the code to increase accessibility for the visually impaired. Moreover, for features like
        buttons, it is not desirable for the screen reader to read out 'left button' or 'right button'. The aria hidden
        feature makes the screen reader skip over the button span so that a visually impaired person does not have to
        listen to the term 'button'. This ensures that the website is more accessible and friendly to people
        with disabilities. The span class 'sr-only' stands for screen reader only, which makes the reader read out
        'previous' or 'next' rather than the whole piece of code.
    </p>

    <p class="text-dark accessp3"> The alt text for the description of images has been carefully and meticulously
        detailed to ensure that blind users understand what the image is about, as they cannot see the image. If an alt
        text is
        not provided, then the screen reader will only read out the word 'image' or may provide a file name. Rather than
        simply giving a name of the image, i tried to imagine what i might relay over the phone when describing the
        image. This
        ensured that the image description flowed with the text before and after it. An example of this can be found on
        the index.html webpage. There is a heading which reads out 'Download the Stunner Group Fitness App' which is
        then followed by buttons which
        have a setting of aria-hidden:"true" so that the buttons are skipped over. The text reader then goes to the
        images of an iPhone with a Stunner Group App on it. Rather than simply calling it 'iPhone image', i have used an
        alt tag of -
        'An iPhone image with the Stunner Group App is shown' and 'a second image with the Stunner Group App is shown.'

        <p class="text-dark accessp4"> I also made sure that the website is keyboard-friendly, increasing the
            accessibility. A
            site is keyboard-friendly if it can function without a mouse, as assistive technologies rely heavily on this
            feature.
            The content and links need to be accessed using the Tab key so that the user can have access to the various
            webpages, icons, and external links. By using the Tab key on the webpages that have been designed, the user
            is able
            to navigate
            between webpages with ease through the navigation links, Stunner Group Logo, buttons, icons and footer
            links. It is
            as simple as pressing the tab key and the enter key.

<div id="Usability" class=" container-fluid bg-light text-justify mt-0 pt-0">
    <h1><u>Usability</u></h1>
    <p class="text-dark usabilityp1"> State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.

        <p class="text-dark usabilityp2"> Before undertaking this coursework, i did not fully appreciate the
            importance of responsiveness when designing a webpage. However, i overcame many obstacles when
            attempting to make various features responsive. The Bootstrap Grid is a very effective
            method for making components responsive and the main documentation that was used as guidance is found on the
            get
            bootstrap website at the following link: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/. I learnt the
            proper implementation of containers and rows in different scenarios. If a container is required for the
            full width of the screen, then
            a container-fluid class can be used rather than a container class. In addition, deciding upon grid
            breakpoints is of great importance, as the layout of components is important when switching from laptop
            screens to mobiles (extra large to extra small). For example, it was my desire to display three
            horizontally aligned cards on an extra large screen, and then two horizontally aligned cards stacked on
            top
            of one card underneath on a medium sized screen. This was done by using the class col-lg-4 so that each
            card takes up 4 units on a maximum of 12 columns on a large screen. Using col-md-6 meant that two cards
            will take up 6 units on a medium sized screen. By using col-sm-12, each card would take up the full
            width
            of the screen, which was needed for small/extra small sized screens (i.e. mobile devices). A feature
            which complimented the grid method was the Bootstrap styling of each component. The background of the
            components can be changed to the range of Bootstrap colours (primary, secondary, success, danger, light,
            dark, warning, info and muted). If you want to change the text colour to the Bootstrap shade of green, then
            you would
            use the class text-success. If you wanted to change the background of a component to the Bootstrap shade
            of red, you would use the class bg-danger. The majority of components such as the navbar, carousel,
            scrollspy and general divisions are styled using Bootstrap colours. I learnt that images are not naturally
            responsive when using Bootstrap. When creating the newproducts.html web page, i had difficulty making
            the images responsive when reducing the
            screen size. The w3 schools website clearly states that a Bootstrap class of img-responsive is the
            method of making an image responsive, found at the following link:
            https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_images.asp. After much searching on various forums, i came
            across a forum named 'stack overflow', found at the following link:
            https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34811268/no-img-responsive-in-bootstrap-4?noredirect=1. A member of
            the forum explained that
            the class img-responsive only works in Bootstrap 3 and that the name of the class has been changed to
            img-fluid in Bootstrap 4. By incorporating responsiveness with various bootstrap classes, i was able to
            increase
            the usability of the site. </p>

        <p class="text-dark usabilityp3">The usability of a site is a measure of the efficiency, effectiveness and
            satisfaction with which a user can navigate around a site. The navbar is a crucial component for users
            to be able to navigate around the various webpages in an efficient and effective manner.
            General documentation for the implementation of the Bootstrap navbar can be found at:
            https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navbar/. To begin with, a structure of an unordered list
            with list items has been used to encapsulate the various navbar links. A class of nav-link has been used
            so that the link can be styled with a hover feature.
            A class of navbar-expand has been used to ensure navbar responsiveness to different sized screens or
            devices.
            The option that I have chosen is navbar-expand-lg which is the large setting for the class. This means
            that the navbar stacks vertically
            when viewed on a small screen device such as an iPad or iPhone. This allows users of a mobile device to
            view the navbar links more effectively and efficiently. On a large screen or laptop, the navbar stacks
            horizontally, unless the screen is minimised; which means that the setting is efficient and effective
            for use on large screen devices as well.
            The bg-dark class has been used to style a dark grey background for the navbar which suits the theme of
            the website, adding to user satisfaction. The various colours that can be used are easily seen in the
            'buttons' section of the Bootstrap documentation, found at the following link:
            https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/buttons/.
            The navbar font has been set as navbar-dark to ensure that an 'off-white' colour is used for the links,
            which contrasts well with the background colour.
            A class of navbar-brand has been created and imbedded with an anchor tag outside and before the unordered
            list to insert the Stunner Group logo as an image. This ensured that the Stunner Group Logo can be
            clicked on, taking a user back to the index page, increasing the efficiency of navigating back to the
            main page. The description on how to insert a brand name
            is provided in the Bootstrap documentation found at the following link:
            https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navbar/. However, the encapsulation of an anchor is not
            documented, and the method of doing so was found at the following forum:
            https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/bootstrap-4-navbar-brand-with-image-and-text/291672.
            I decided to move the unordered list (navbar links) to the right of the screen as it stops the navbar
            from having a height that is excessive on smaller screens, making the site more desirable for users.
            This was done by adding a margin with a class of ml-auto to the unordered list.
            The auto element of the class pushes the text with as much margin that can be created to the edge of the
            screen. In addition, a hamburger menu has been incorporated for the navbar links when the screen is
            minimised to a certain size, or when viewing the content from a smartphone or iPad.
            This ensures a level of responsiveness and efficiency, as users of a small screen can easily toggle the
            hamburger to view the navbar links. The 'toggler' section of the formal Bootstrap documentation was
            referenced when building the code from scratch, and is found at the following link:
            : https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navbar/#toggler. To ensure that the hamburger menu
            functions, a button has been added which targets the specific ID of #navbarTogglerDemo02 so that it
            knows which division to collapse or expand when the hamburger icon is clicked on.
            Also note how the anchor tag for the brand has been placed above the button, as this ensures that the
            brand is shown on the left of the screen and the button is shown on the right of the screen when in
            mobile/small screen mode. Another important iteration is that the ml-auto class has
            been moved from the unordered list to the div container so that the navbar text still appears on the
            right of the screen, which was only implemented through trial and error. All of these developments
            ensure that the user can effectively and efficiently navigate around the site. </p>

        <p class="text-dark usabilityp4"> Website usability is also aimed towards customer service and meeting the
            needs of the user. Therefore, icons have been used from Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/) in
            different areas of the site. The footer incorporates the Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn icons
            wrapped within an anchor tag to ensure that
            users can visit the Stunner Group Fitness social media sites upon the click of an icon. In addition, if
            the user wants to download the Stunner Group Fitness App, they can click on the download button in the
            index.html page which takes the user to the App store, or Google store. This increases the ease of use
            and improves the site usability. Icons were
            also used in the newproducts.html page when giving descriptions of each new protein powder, increasing
            the relevancy of each point, and ensuring that each point has a high level of clarity (as the icons
            match each description).

<div id="Learning" class="container-fluid bg-light text-justify mt-0 pt-0">
    <h1><u>Learning</u></h1>
    <p class="text-dark learningp1">State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site,
        and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any
        changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</p>
    <p class="text-dark learningp2"> In the last semester, i took a module named Introduction to Programming 1, and
        i created a bubble effect, where bubbles would move across a canvas. In this coursework assignment, I created a canvas in HTML, 
        and gave it an ID of mycanvas. I then started to create the code in the events.js file, and declared the canvas variables
        and targeted the canvas element with the getElementByID command.
        I then set my context variable with canvas.getContext('2d'). The canvas height and width has been set to the
        window width and height. To get the current mouse position, i created an event listener with the same
        methods taught in the course material, and has been used to get the current mouse position, and works every
        time the user moves the mouse. I then created a class for the bubbles,
        to fill the bubble array, so that individual bubbles would have randomised values. I have used constructor
        functions and learnt how to use them effectively by looking at an example on w3 schools at the following
        URL: https://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_object_constructors.asp. In addition, each bubble needed x and y
        coordinates, which are independent from mouse x and mouse y coordinates. Direction x
        and direction y holds the number of bubbles animated along each step in the x and y axis, and ensures
        the bubbles will be bouncing back and forth around the canvas. Individual bubbles are drawn and are
        repeated via the update function and for every frame of the animation. The bubble screen position and
        mouse interaction is also updated on each frame. The check bubble position is a technique
        learnt in the module Introduction to Programming 1, which checks the current bubble position, checks the
        mouse position, moves the bubble accordingly, and then calls the draw method. As the bubbles bounce around
        the canvas, the purpose of the code is to check if the bubbles have reached the edge of the screen. If the
        bubble reaches the edge of the screen, then the direction is reversed through the directionX or
        directionY to make it animate in the opposite direction. I then also incorporated collision detection, which
        was also covered in the module Intro to Programming 1. To do this, i took the centre point of the mouse
        curser and the centre point of the bubble, and checked if the distance between the two centre points is less
        than a set distance. The formula of 'dx*dx +dy*dy' was taken from the forum - stack overflow at the following
        URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4578111/calculating-distance-between-two-x-y-coordinates-in-php.
        The forum member wanted a similar solution for collision detection when working in the games industry, and i
        found
        it to be useful and implemented it as part of my Javascript code. A series of 'if statements' are used in
        the code, by initially checking if mouseX is smaller than this.x (current position). If this is true, then
        we
        know that the mouse is to the left of the bubble; and so the bubble should be pushed to the right (+
        direction in the x-axis). Another 'if' statement checks if the bubble is far enough from the edge of the
        canvas, as we do not want to push it over the edge of the canvas. This has been done for all four sides of the
        screen,
        pushing the bubbles back before they get the chance to overflow. After these checks have been made, the
        other bubbles which are not
        colliding with the mouse are pushed along the x or y axis by adding their 'this.x' values to their direction
        x and direction y values. They are then drawn by calling the function this.draw(). After these steps
        were completed, a randomised function was created named function init (). A bubble array variable was
        assigned to an empty bubble array. The number of bubbles have been created under this function. At this
        point i faced difficulties
        in implementing random bubbles so i took guidance from one specific section in the example at the following
        URL: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generating-a-particle-system-with-javascript--net-10668. I was able
        to use the guidance to create a random size (between 1 and 5). The let direction x and let direction y
        determine the movement speed. A bubble object was then
        created with randomised values and the Array.push method was used as learnt in the module - Introduction to
        Programming 1 to push the values into the empty bubble array. The animation loop was then created with
        guidance from the following article: https://muffinman.io/javascript-animation-loop/. The function has been
        named animate, and a requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation/ update method has been called for
        each individual bubble with a for loop. Finally, the function init is called and so is animate.
    </p>

    <p class="text-dark learningp3"> I created a calorie calculator which took in an input of pounds and displayed
        an output of calories and grams of protein, carbohydrates and fats. Bootstrap 4 was used for the user
        interface. The following resource/URL was used - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l-ZAuU8TXc as a guideline,
        however, the example shown in the video is not responsive using Bootstrap methodology and is a different
        converter to the one i developed as part of the site. The video is provided by Brad Traversy and he shows
        how to create a weight converter, which converts pounds to grams, kilograms, and ounces.
        I made major changes so that i have multiple calculators giving desirable outputs required by the owner of
        Stunner Group Fitness. In addition, Bootstrap cards were used with specific Bootstrap classes to ensure that
        the cards are responsive. The application of Javascript
        as part of the development of the calorie/macro calculator was a learning experience. For the first time, i
        was using the 'document.getelementByID' to grab an input, and then added an event listener to listen for an
        input event and ran a function. I then created a variable
        named pounds and passed through an event parameter (e.target.value). Outputs were then displayed by using
        the technique of document.getElementByID().innerHTML with a mathematical calculation of outputs for each
        different state and output. For example, the user inputs their bodyweight in pounds,
        and then three values are provided to the user for the amount of calories they require for gaining muscle
        (bulking calories), reducing body fat (cutting calories), and maintaining weight (maintenance calories). Each
        of these three states are based on three different mathematical calculations, which were not present in the
        online video. I adapted the code so that the calculators are styled and produce inputs and outputs in alignment
        with the theme of the website.
        A similar method was used to generate the macro calculator. The user inputs the amount of calories they want
        to eat per day, and the amount of grams they need to eat are given as an output in terms of proteins,
        carbohydrates and fats. Another major difference between the calorie calculator and the
        macro calculator is the type of cards used when styling in Bootstrap. All information on different card
        types are found at: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/ and the calculators have been
        imbedded inside Bootstrap cards.

    <p class="text-dark learningp4"> A hamburger menu was incorporated so that the navbar links display vertically
        on a small sized screen. The navbar has been incorporated on each webpage, however, it was covering part of
        the first division of each page. I searched for the solution on Google, coming across various
        websites which did not provide a solution that i could implement. I typically searched topics such as -
        'navbar covering division on small screen' until i came across the answer on a forum at the following URL:
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13550541/media-min-width-max-width, which showed an Advanced CSS
        technique to overcome the issue. I was able to adopt the
        @media (max-width:) command to set a breakpoint at 575px (approx small screen size) at which point the top
        padding was altered. This ensured that the body padding was increased and that the navbar does not sit on top of
        the
        division underneath it when in small screen mode. A modification to this technique was also adopted to ensure
        that the
        bubble effect on the events webpage disappears at a breakpoint of 1000px. This was implemented using the command
        -
        @media only screen and (max-width:1000px). I later learnt that this technique is also available in
        the Bootstrap framework, and i used the following classes in the index.html page: d-none d-lg-block
        d-xl-block (display none on any size other than extra large and large). This ensured that the Stunner Group App
        images
        only show on a large and extra large screen, but disappear on smaller screen sizes.

<div id="improved" class=" container-fluid bg-light text-justify mt-0 pt-0">
    <h1><u>Improvement</u></h1>
    <p class="text-dark improvedp1">What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things
        differently another time?</p>
    <p class="text-dark improvedp2">Advanced CSS techniques were used to create a type effect in the
        newproducts.html page. The way in which the typewriter effect is implemented was taken from the following
        URL: https://codepen.io/geoffgraham/pen/jrWwWM. However, the code was adapted and additional commands were
        added to ensure that it functioned correctly within the website i created. A division class of type effect
        was simply created in the html file and then CSS was used to ensure the effect functions correctly. The
        position of the type effect was set to relative at a left position of 10% and an overflow:hidden
        property was set to ensure that none of the text can be seen until it is typed out by the typewriter. A
        colour of #8f8f8f was given to the text so that it blends within the theme of the website. Even so,
        the responsiveness of the typewriter effect could have been improved in the medium sized screen setting.
        If i was to do things differently another time, i would either only keep the typewriter on a large screen by
        removing it on a medium or small sized screen (with the @media command) or i would find a way of making the
        font size smaller so that it fits the width of the page on smaller screen sizes.
    </p>

    <p class="text-dark improvedp3"> I had a great time implementing the handlebars.js methodology into the
        newproducts.html webpage for the product purchase heading and paragraph. Handlebars.js helpers were incorporated
        by creating a helper with a 'caps' command ensuring that the dynamic
        heading is capitalised. This is done by returning a text through a function and then transforming it to
        uppercase. Therefore, in the newproducts.html webpage, the options.hash.lower is set to no, which means that
        the title 'Protein Shake Purchase'
        is set to capitals. If this is changed to 'yes', then the title changes to lowercase. In addition to this,
        the same template is used to create a paragraph underneath the heading which tells the user that he or she
        needs to go to the main
        Stunner Group site to purchase the products. The helper name was changed, and a switch statement was added to
        allow the code to switch between languages. Three different cases were added - English, French and German for
        the paragraph underneath
        the Protein Purchase heading. The second part of the template function passes in data and sets the language.
        I have set the language as English ('en'). However, by changing this part of the code to 'de', the text
        switches to
        German. If the code is changed to 'fr', then the text turns into French. I believe that i used Handlebars
        helpers effectively to showcase their functionality. However, one aspect i would conduct differently next
        time is to use the handlebars templates to enable
        a different language for every piece of text on each webpage. Therefore, by simply changing the state, the
        entire webpage text would change from English to German or French. This would be much more impressive than
        simply changing one line of text. In addition,
        i would create a separate handlebars.js file to keep all of the handlebars code in one place, rather than
        imbedding it as script tags into the html file. This will then fall in alignment with the way in which i
        have separated other Javascript code to their own files. </q>

<div id="Worked Well" class=" container-fluid bg-light text-justify mt-0 pt-0">
    <h1><u>Worked Well</u></h1>
    <p class="text-dark workedwellp1">What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</p>
    <p class="text-dark workedwellp2">As part of the news.html page, a scrollspy was created to display different
        news articles using the Bootstrap scrollspy component. Guidance for the creation of the scrollspy can be
        found at the main Bootstrap website: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/scrollspy/. This aspect of
        the website works particularly well. The reason why it works well is because a secondary navbar has been
        created to help navigate different news articles. For example, by clicking on a navbar link such as
        'Coronavirus', the user is taken directly to the division which gives news on Coronavirus. The site also
        displays news which is relevant and up-to-date. This
        aspect is important, as users appreciate websites that are up-to-date. In addition, a carousel was
        created in the index.html page, and guidance for the creation was taken from the main bootstrap website at:
        https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/carousel/#with-controls. The carousel was implemented
        effectively and shows results of weight training enthusiasts that have taken protein supplements to achieve a
        reduction in body fat
        and increase in muscle mass. By using the buttons to scroll left and right, the user can view the different
        testimonials, which works well within the design of the site.
        The scrollspy and carousel are not the only elements which are carefully imbedded into the code for maximum
        design impact. Other aspects or Bootstrap components such as the navbar, bubble effect, Jumbotron, Forms,
        Buttons, Cards have been imbedded and styled using both Bootstrap classes and CSS styling. This ensured that
        all aspects of the site were styled in accordance to the techniques learnt in the module, and with additional
        techniques
        learnt through searches and research.
        The way in which the website was styled using CSS styling techniques worked well. The reason why it worked
        well was due to the different types of techniques used to achieve the desired outcome. Various types of
        padding and margin were applied to create spacing effectively (especially between divisions). Fonts were
        styled by assigning font-family,size and weight. An overflow in the
        x direction was hidden which ensured that the user cannot scroll in the x-direction. Certain elements of the
        page were positioned using the absolute and relative options where necessary, and text was was either set to
        centered, justify or left aligned in accordance to the design requirement. To set the distance, components
        were positioned either top, left, right or
        bottom from a relative or absolute position. Other advanced CSS techniques were used such as Z-index to give
        components an order of precedence in the z-direction. A border and a border radius was either set to none or
        given a value based on the style requirements of the site. In certain instances, a complex component is not
        required to make a feature look impressive. This is why the
        Bootstrap grid was used in the newproducts.html section with specific column settings to ensure that a
        fluid image is incorporated whilst the text sits around the image in six blocks of text. This pattern is
        then repeated for the other two products. This feature works well, as the design impact is high and the
        responsiveness of the text and the images remains intact when the user minimises the screen
        or opens the webpage from a small screen device.
